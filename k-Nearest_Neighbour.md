# K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR  
The k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a type of instance-based 
learning or lazy learning, where the algorithm simply stores all of the available training data and makes predictions based on the similarity between new input data 
and the training data.  
In k-NN, the "k" refers to the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making a prediction. Given a new data point, the algorithm finds the k data points in the 
training set that are closest to it in terms of some distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance). The algorithm then predicts the class or value 
of the new data point based on the most common class or the average value of the k nearest neighbors.  
The choice of the value of k is important and can impact the accuracy of the model. A small value of k may lead to overfitting, while a large value of k may lead to 
underfitting. Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate value of k that balances the bias-variance trade-off in the model.  
k-NN is a simple and interpretable algorithm, and it can work well on small datasets or when the decision boundary is irregular. However, it can be computationally 
expensive and may not work well on high-dimensional data. Additionally, it may be sensitive to the choice of distance metric and preprocessing of the data.  

here's a **simple example** of how k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm works for a classification task:  

Suppose we have a dataset of 20 fruits, each with features of weight in grams and sweetness level on a scale of 1 to 10, along with their corresponding labels of 
"Apple" or "Orange". We want to use k-NN algorithm to predict the label of a new fruit with unknown label based on its weight and sweetness level.
First, we split the dataset into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%). Then, we choose a value of k, let's say k=3.  
Next, when given a new fruit with unknown label, the k-NN algorithm finds the 3 fruits in the training set that are closest to the new fruit based on their weight and 
sweetness level. This is done by computing the Euclidean distance between the new fruit and each fruit in the training set.  
Assuming the k nearest neighbors are 2 apples and 1 orange, the algorithm predicts the label of the new fruit based on the majority class of the k neighbors, which in 
this case is "Apple". Thus, the algorithm would predict the new fruit to be an "Apple".  
This is just a basic example, and in practice, the k-NN algorithm can be applied to more complex datasets and with different distance metrics.  

To find the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) in learning models, we typically follow these steps:  

**1)Choose a distance metric:** The first step is to choose a distance metric that measures the similarity or dissimilarity between the new data point and the training data points. The most commonly used distance metric is the Euclidean distance, but other metrics such as Manhattan distance or cosine similarity can also be used.

**2)Calculate distances:** The next step is to calculate the distances between the new data point and all the training data points using the chosen distance metric. This results in a list of distances, with each distance corresponding to a training data point.

**3)Select the k-Nearest Neighbors:** The k-NN algorithm selects the k training data points with the smallest distances to the new data point. These are the k-Nearest Neighbors.

**4)Determine the prediction:** Once the k-Nearest Neighbors have been identified, the k-NN algorithm determines the prediction for the new data point. For classification tasks, the predicted class is determined by the majority class of the k-Nearest Neighbors. For regression tasks, the predicted value is determined by the average value of the k-Nearest Neighbors.

**5)Set value of k:** The value of k determines how many neighbors are considered when making a prediction. This value can be set by the user or determined using cross-validation or other techniques.

**6)Evaluate the model:** After the k-NN algorithm has been applied to the training data, the performance of the model can be evaluated using a variety of metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for classification tasks, or mean squared error and R-squared for regression tasks.

Overall, finding the k-Nearest Neighbors involves calculating the distances between the new data point and all the training data points, selecting the k data points with the smallest distances, and using them to make a prediction. The performance of the model can then be evaluated using appropriate metrics. 

## THE CHOICE OF K
The choice of k, the number of neighbors to consider in the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm, is an important hyperparameter that can have a significant impact on the performance of the learning model. Both small and large values of k have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on the specific problem and dataset.  

**Small k:**  

With smaller values of k, the decision boundary between the classes becomes more complex and flexible, which can result in higher accuracy on training data and potentially better prediction accuracy on test data.  
However, with smaller values of k, the model may be more sensitive to noise and outliers in the training data, resulting in overfitting. In other words, the model may learn the noise and idiosyncrasies of the training data too closely, making it less effective in generalizing to new data.  
Small values of k are more appropriate for datasets with simple or nonlinear decision boundaries, as well as for datasets with low noise and outliers.  

**Large k:**  

With larger values of k, the decision boundary between the classes becomes smoother and more linear, which can make the model more robust to noise and outliers in the training data.  
However, with larger values of k, the model may become too simple and underfit the training data, resulting in lower accuracy on both training and test data.  
Large values of k are more appropriate for datasets with large amounts of noise or outliers, as well as for datasets with simple or linear decision boundaries.
