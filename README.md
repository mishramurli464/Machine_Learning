# Machine_Learning
There are three broad types of machine learning:

Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, where the input features and the corresponding output labels are provided. The goal is to learn a mapping between the input features and the output labels. Examples of supervised learning include image classification, sentiment analysis, and regression analysis.

Unsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, where the input features are provided, but the corresponding output labels are not. The goal is to find hidden patterns or structures in the data. Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns by interacting with an environment, where it receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. Examples of reinforcement learning include game playing, robotics, and recommendation systems.
