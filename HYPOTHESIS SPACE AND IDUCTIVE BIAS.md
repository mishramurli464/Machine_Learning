## Inductive learning  
Inductive learning is a type of machine learning that involves the process of learning patterns or regularities in data and making predictions based on those patterns.
In inductive learning, the machine learning algorithm works by analyzing a set of training data, which contains examples of input-output pairs, and then inferring a 
general rule or pattern that can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

2)Handwriting recognition  
3)Predictive modeling  

## TERMINOLOGY
Features: The number of features or distinct traits that can be used to describe each item in a quantitative manner.  
Feature vector: n-dimensional vector of numerical features that represent some object  
Instance Space X: Set of all possible objects describable by features.each instance is the point in the features space    
Example (x,y): Instance x with label y=f(x).  
Concept c: Subset of objects from X (c is unknown).  
Target Function f: Maps each instance x EX to target label y EY  
Example (x,y): Instance x with label y=f(x).  
Training Data S: Collection of examples observed by learning algorithm.

## hypothesis space  
Hypothesis space is a key concept in inductive learning, which refers to the set of all possible hypotheses or models that can be used to explain a given dataset.  
In other words, the hypothesis space defines the range of functions or relationships that can be learned by a machine learning algorithm.
