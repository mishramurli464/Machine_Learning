# CLUSTERING
Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points together based on their similarity or distance to each other. The goal 
of clustering is to identify natural groupings in the data without prior knowledge of the labels or categories.  
In clustering, data points are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space, and the distance or similarity between these vectors is used to group similar data 
points together. There are several methods used to compute the distance or similarity between data points, such as Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, and Jaccard 
distance.
