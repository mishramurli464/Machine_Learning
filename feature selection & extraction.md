# CURSE OF DIMENSIONALIST 
The curse of dimensionality refers to the fact that as the number of input variables or features in a machine learning model increases, the amount of data needed  
to learn accurately increases exponentially. This is because the volume of the input space increases exponentially with the number of dimensions, making it   
difficult for the model to identify patterns and relationships within the data.  
Suppose we have a dataset of 1,000 images, where each image is 28x28 pixels (i.e., 784 pixels in total). We want to train a neural network to classify these   
images into 10 different categories (e.g., cat, dog, car, airplane, etc.).
Now, let's imagine that we decide to add a new feature to each image: the average pixel intensity. This means we now have 785 input features instead of 784.
At first glance, adding just one additional feature might not seem like a big deal. However, the curse of dimensionality tells us that as we add more and more   
features, the amount of data needed to learn accurately increases exponentially.  
To see this, let's consider what happens if we add another new feature to each image: the standard deviation of the pixel intensities. This means we now have 786   
input features instead of 785.  
If we plot the number of training examples required to achieve a certain level of accuracy as a function of the number of input features, we might see a trend   
like this:

**784 features:** 500 training examples needed to achieve 90% accuracy  
**785 features:** 1,000 training examples needed to achieve 90% accuracy  
**786 features:** 2,000 training examples needed to achieve 90% accuracy  
**787 features:** 4,000 training examples needed to achieve 90% accuracy  
...
As we can see, the amount of data needed to achieve a certain level of accuracy increases rapidly as we add more features. This is the curse of dimensionality in action.  
## FEATURE REDUCTION
Feature reduction is the process of reducing the number of input variables or features used in a machine learning model while still retaining the most important    
information. The goal of feature reduction is to improve model efficiency, reduce overfitting, and improve the interpretability of the model  
### FEATURE SELECTION
Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables or input data) from a larger set of potential features, to be used  
in a machine learning model. The goal of feature selection is to reduce the dimensionality of the data, improve model performance, and reduce overfitting.  

Here are a few examples of feature selection in learning models:

**a)Linear Regression:** In linear regression, feature selection can be used to select a subset of relevant features that are highly correlated with the target  
variable. For example, in predicting the price of a house, features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location might be selected.

**b)Decision Trees:** In decision trees, feature selection can be used to select the most important features that split the data effectively. For example, in   
classifying whether an email is spam or not, features such as the presence of certain keywords, the senderâ€™s email address, and the time the email was  
received might be selected.
