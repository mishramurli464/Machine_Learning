# CLUSTERING
Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points together based on their similarity or distance to each other. The goal 
of clustering is to identify natural groupings in the data without prior knowledge of the labels or categories.  
In clustering, data points are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space, and the distance or similarity between these vectors is used to group similar data 
points together. There are several methods used to compute the distance or similarity between data points, such as Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, and Jaccard 
distance.

## Aspects of clustering  

**A clustering algorithm such as**  
--Partitional clustering eg, kmeans   
--Hierarchical clustering eg, AHC  
--Mixture of Gaussians  

**A distance or similarity function*
- such as Euclidean, Minkowski, cosine

**Clustering quality**

**Inter-clusters distance**â‡’ maximized

**Intra-clusters distance**=> minimized   

## APPLICATION
Clustering is a widely used technique in machine learning and data science, and it has many practical applications in various fields. Some of the most common applications of clustering include:

**Customer segmentation:** Clustering can be used to group customers with similar characteristics or behaviors together, allowing companies to tailor their marketing strategies and products to specific customer groups.

**Image segmentation:** Clustering can be used to group similar pixels in an image together to separate objects from the background, identify different regions of an image, or reduce the amount of data needed to represent an image.

**Anomaly detection:** Clustering can be used to identify data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data, which can be useful in detecting fraud or identifying faulty equipment.
